    # number of replicas, i.e. parallel deployments. You can have one model instance per GPU.
    # I believe it is possible to have multiple replicas (subject to available GPU memory) on a single GPU, but that often leads to memory issues. You can try and see how it goes.
    # For example, if you want to deploy a model on 8 GPUs, num_replicas should be 8.

    ray_actor_options:
      num_cpus: 1.0 # You do need at least 1 CPU per replica.
      num_gpus: 1.0 # Higher if one instance of your model needs more than 1 GPU.
      # If one instance of your models needs 2 GPUs and you have 8 GPUs total, then num_replicas should be 4 (8 / 2), otherwise your deployment will have insufficent resources.

  # You can add more models under the deployments section. 
  # You can also decouple multiple models across different files and have one config to drive the full deployment together.
  # There are many other configurations that you can dive deeper into here - https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/configure-serve-deployment.html#serve-configure-deployment
